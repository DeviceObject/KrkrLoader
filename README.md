# KrkrLoader
KrkrLoader  
Allow you run some krkr2-based game on Windows8 OS and above.  

At present supported:  
1.check child process - If the original game launched by a launcher(the same as some translated games),  
krkrLoader will inject into the child process to make sure the krkr module is injected.  
2.modify - if the target exe is protected from injection, this option will do something for U,  
BUT I it can't do anything if the target exe's IAT is warpped by a shell.  
3.Locale Emulator - not done yet! so DON'T use this function at present.
